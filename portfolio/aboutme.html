            <p>Hello there! My name is Jazib and I aspire to be a software developer in the future. I
                currently know Java and Python pretty well, but I plan on expanding on my knowledge in these languages
                and learning additional languages such as C, C#, and JavaScript. I also have quite a bit of knowledge in
                Cybersecurity, as I have some certifications that you can see on my certifications page. <br><br> My favorite
                things to do are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Play Video Games</li>
                <li>Code</li>
                <li>Watch Formula 1</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here is a picture of one of my cats:</p>
